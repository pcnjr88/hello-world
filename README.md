My Name is Prince and am form ATL, GA. I currently work in the healthcare field on the revenue cycle side but i am no longer passionate about my career as i was when i first graduated from college. I realized about two years ago that i wanted to get into IT but didn't know where to start so i just kept dreaming of what could've been. I am now at a place where i don't like what i do for a living and am tired of dreaming of what could've been if I got into IT so now am doing something about.
